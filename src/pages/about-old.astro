          My Journey
        </h1>

        <p class="mt-6 text-xl/8">
          Hi! I&apos;m Tanya. There was a point in my life when everything fell
          apart. Literally everything&mdash;everything familiar, everything
          tangible, everything I thought I could rely on. It felt as if I were
          walking steadily along, only to have the carpet pulled out from under
          me mid-step.

                That moment marked the beginning of a journey I never
                expected&mdash;a journey of self-discovery that eventually
                brought me to a path of serving and helping others.

          <p class="mt-6">
            My health was one of the first things to suffer. My adrenals simply
            couldn&apos;t cope with the overwhelming, unprecedented stress.
            Mentally and emotionally, I was in complete chaos. I didn&apos;t
            know what to do, where to turn, or how to even begin building a new
            life, especially as a middle-aged woman. It didn&apos;t take long
            for me to realise that blaming others or looking outside myself for
            solutions was futile.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            In the midst of it all, the only person who could pull me out of
            this situation was me. So, I turned to self-help books, and one
            thing led to another. Slowly, I began to understand something
            life-changing: our physical health is rarely separate from our
            mental and emotional states.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            In fact, it&apos;s often a direct reflection of them. That
            realisation propelled me into an extraordinary journey—a non-dual
            spiritual path that eventually led me to Tibetan Buddhism.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            Meditation, quite literally, saved my life. With that foundation, I
            was finally able to shift my focus back to my physical body.
            Functional medicine became my next deep dive because its principles
            simply made sense to me.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            Yes, I had learned how crucial mental and emotional well-being is,
            but I also knew that guessing what my body needed wasn&apos;t
            enough. Each of us is unique. Our biochemical make-up differs, and
            without proper screening and diagnostics grounded in science,
            it&apos;s nearly impossible to truly understand what&apos;s going on
            inside.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            When we combine that scientific insight with smart lifestyle
            choices, mental and emotional resilience, and a spiritual path that
            brings meaning and joy, something powerful happens. It creates a
            robust and meaningful roadmap to guide you towards where you want to
            go—not just in your health, but in your life.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6">
            Today, I feel so fortunate to share everything I&apos;ve learned,
            all the expertise I&apos;ve gained through years of study,
            exploration, and self-discovery, to help others. Helping hundreds of
            people navigate their own paths has been one of the most rewarding
            parts of my journey. If you&apos;re reading this, know that no
            matter where you&apos;re starting from, change is possible. Growth
            is possible. And a life of vitality, balance, and meaning is within
            reach.

            Why Functional Medicine?
          </h1>

          <p class="mt-6 text-xl/8">
            Functional Medicine is a science-based, patient-centred approach to
            healthcare that focuses on identifying and addressing the root
            causes of disease, rather than merely treating symptoms. It
            recognises that each individual is unique, with factors such as
            genetics, environment, and lifestyle playing a critical role in
            overall health.

              <blockquote class="font-semibold text-avocado">
                <p class="mt-6 text-2xl/8 font-serif">
                  By using advanced diagnostics, Functional Medicine seeks to
                  uncover imbalances within the body&apos;s systems—whether
                  biochemical, hormonal, or immune-related—and creates
                  personalised treatment plans to restore balance and optimise
                  well-being.

              This approach often integrates nutrition, lifestyle changes, and
              targeted supplementation, alongside conventional medical
              treatments when necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6">
              With an emphasis on prevention, early detection, and addressing
              the underlying causes, Functional Medicine offers a comprehensive
              path to long-term health, vitality, and disease prevention.
